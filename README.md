# Microbit

This repository contains the source code of `Microbit` operating system.
It is called `Microbit` because it is mostly coded in `Micro` code editor in `Linux` and it is a tiny operating system ðŸ”¥.

## Building

First, you have to install `qemu`, `nasm`, `make` and `micro`.
To install those you have to run `build.sh`. It will automaticly install the libraries and run the project. If you want to run the operating system individually, just run `run.sh` with `./run.sh` .

## Debugging

First, you have to install `qemu`, `nasm`, `make` and `micro`.

Just run debug `debug.sh` by `./debug.sh`.

## Contributing
